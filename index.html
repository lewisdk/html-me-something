                <p>Deirdre was born in a tiny northeast corner of Maine - 
                    practically in Canada, but would not have any memories of
                    her birth place, as her family moved overseas to Germany
                    when she was but a few months old. That is where she made 
                    her very earliest memories. As fate would have it, though,
                    her family, after living a few other places first, ended up
                    back in Maine, though neither of her parents were either from
                    nor had any family there. It was a great place to grow up, but 
                    she couldn't wait to get away and see the world. She joined the 
                    Air Force after graduating from college. That's where she met 
                    her husband, and neither of them ended up in a job field that 
                    would send them overseas. Such luck! They started a family, 
                    though and have had many adventures anyway.

                    <h2>Family</h2>
                    <p>Deirdre has 4 children, three girls and a boy, who keep her
                        quite busy. Her husband is still in the Air Force, which has made
                        establishing a career or pursuing education a bit tricky. As a family,
                        they love to go camping, on bike rides and hikes, playing games (her 
                        middle daughter in particular is big into games), and cook and eat food.
                        Her older daughters danced in the Nutcracker ballet this past Christmas
                        season, and are currently very busy with girl scout activities. All three
                        girls dance, and her son is not yet old enough to do extra curriculars - 
                        she is sure outright chaos will be life once he is also old enough.

                <h2>Work and Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Deirdre has attempted to pursue a professional degree a few times, only
               to be thwarted by either the addition of a child to their family or a move 
               - yay military life! (Don't misread that - she loves the opportunity to 
               experience new places.) Since the birth of her oldest, she delved deeper into 
               a lifelong passion of hers: photography. She had an adorable little model to 
               practice on, so why not? She has maintained a photography business over the 
               past 8 years, starting up again every time they have moved (which has been about 
               3 or 4 times). It's challenging, but the work makes her happy and gives her a 
               creative outlet, if not a steady income. When she saw the opportunity to learn
               coding through launchcode, though, she jumped at the chance! Perhaps, just perhaps, 
               she could learn coding well enough to find a job as a front end web developer.
               She had been looking into online schools to get into the field, but the programs
               she had been finding were, as her husband put it, full of fluff. She would love to
               be able to develop a beautiful website for her own business - none of the templates
               she finds ever end up fitting her vision - as well, as perhaps make a living 
               designing them for others.

           <h2>Photography</h2>
           <p>As mentioned, Deirdre is a photographer. When she sits and thinks about what she wants
           to do in her life, the answer is and always has been, if she's being honest, photography.
           Previous to having children, she thought she would try to be a photographer for National
           Geographic; travel the world and get paid to take photos of what she saw. I mean, who 
           doesn't want to get paid to do what they love? They say you never work a day, if you are 
           doing what you love, right? She didn't end up doing that, obviously, but started a family,
           which led to photographing babies, children, and families instead. It's wonderful, and she 
           loves it, but does still hope to be able to travel for photography and perhaps put together
           a book someday. Perhaps, coding will help her to be able to accomplish this. Deirdre currently 
           specializes in maternity, newborn, child, and family photography. She does occasionally 
           photograph boudoir and weddings, and welcomes it as a change of pace! You can see examples of
           her work <a href="www.facebook.com/picturesofprose">here</a>. Her website is currently down for 
           rennovation.
